# Note: the order of installing various components below is NOT random.
# It is deliberately adapted to nuances related to dependencies between
# system packages, eg. on Debian/Ubuntu, MTA (Postfix/ssmtp) should be
# installed before packages that rely on any installed MTA, because if
# not, then Exim (as the default MTA) will be installed during the setup
# process. Or if rsyslog will be reconfigured (by sf-log-manager) too
# early, then in some rare circumstances it may properly receive local
# messages, but fail to receive messages forwarded from other hosts.

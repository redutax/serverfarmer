Server Farmer is a lightweight framework designed for companies, that manage
many servers and services belonging to many different customers, but connected
into a single managed platform.

As of 2018, Server Farmer has over 10 years of history of managing production
servers (which is longer than in competing Chef framework), including over
3 years of being successful open source project. It was used to manage the
infrastructure for over 160 customers, consisted of over 650 physical/virtual
servers and containers, located in multiple data centers, in almost 10 major
cities in Poland, at least 2 cities in Germany, and over 140 cloud instances
hosted by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace Cloud, physically
located across the whole world.

## Advantages of Server Farmer over managing individual servers

No matter if you manage just a single server, or hundreds of them, installing
Server Farmer gives you many advantages over default OS configuration:

- consistent and reliable tools to manage many servers at once (or one by one)
- improved server security in various areas
- several monitoring and alerting capabilities
- automatic, possibly encrypted backups
- working MTA configuration (your servers are now able to send emails)
- central logging configuration (all logs are stored and processed in one place, enhancing security of your infrastructure)
- hardened network stack, immune from participation in DDoS attacks

## Differences between Server Farmer and competitive tools

The main difference between Server Farmer and the competitive tools (mostly
Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt and CFEngine) is that **Server Farmer is designed
to manage a completely heterogeneous environment**, where servers:

- are owned by many different companies
- have different operating systems
- have different configurations
- have different installed services and applications
- have different system users, groups and permissions
- have different roles and purposes

To achieve that, Server Farmer is mainly focused on low-level server security
aspects, and doesn't try to cover the application level at all. As opposite,
most mentioned tools mentioned tools focus mainly on the application level,
providing more-or-less complete "Infrastructure As Code" frameworks.

## Advantages of Server Farmer over competitive tools

Most server management tools (Puppet, Chef etc.) are designed with corporate
mindset ("where the money is"), and follow "one managed application/customer - one
instance" model, which is suitable mainly for big companies, with lots of servers
and big applications. Such model is however obviously too expensive for companies
that have 1-5 servers overall.

As opposite to that model, Server Farmer is built from ground up to manage many
customers, applications etc. using only one instance shared across all customers,
which is much cheaper, in both technical resources (servers, repositories etc.),
and man-hours.

Server Farmer basic configuration can be set up just in a few minutes and then
extended, when your server farm is growing. You can also implement your own
functional extensions (just like Ansible playbooks or Chef recipes, but much
more simple), that will cover completely new functionalities - or you can use
Server Farmer with Ansible, whichever better fits your needs.

## How to install Server Farmer on your first server

Server Farmer consists of over 60 Git repositories. But don't worry, you will
need to fork only 2 of them (this one and `sf-keys`), and start with editing
just one small file: `scripts/functions.custom`.

After forking, clone this repository to `/opt/farm` directory on your server:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-github-login/serverfarmer /opt/farm
```

Then run `setup.sh` script and just follow the simple on-screen instructions:

```
/opt/farm/setup.sh
```

## How to deploy Server Farmer into cloud

Server Farmer supports the following public cloud providers:

- Amazon EC2
- Beyond e24cloud.com
- Google Compute Engine
- Hetzner Cloud (and also Hetzner "classic" dedicated servers)
- Microsoft Azure
- Rackspace Cloud
- any cloud service based on OpenStack (including public, private and hybrid clouds)

([see the full manual](http://serverfarmer.org/cloud-integration.html))

Initial setup:

- choose a server for the farm manager role (no special requirements, except that all management extensions are tested mainly on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS)
- install Server Farmer on it, along with sf-farm-manager and sf-farm-provisioning extensions (preferably also sf-backup-collector and sf-farm-inspector)
- install Cloud Farmer on it and configure it, providing your cloud API keys and other details (interactively)

```
git clone https://github.com/serverfarmer/cloudfarmer /opt/cloud
```

- creating new cloud instance

```
/opt/cloud/create.sh ec2 test_key1 m4.xlarge
```

- deploy Server Farmer on created instance

```
sf-provision ec2-54-123-45-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com /etc/local/.ssh/id_ec2_test_key1 test_profile
```

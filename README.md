Server Farmer is a lightweight framework designed for companies, that manage
many servers and services belonging to many different customers, but connected
into a single managed platform.

As of 2017, Server Farmer has over 9 years of history of managing, production
servers (which is longer than in competing Chef framework), including over
2 years of being successful open source project. It was used to manage the
infrastructure for over 150 customers, consisted of over 600 physical/virtual
servers and containers, located in multiple data centers, in almost 10 major
cities in Poland, at least 2 cities in Germany, and over 100 cloud instances
hosted by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace Cloud, physically
located across the whole world.

## Advantages of Server Farmer over manual server management

No matter if you manage just a single server, or hundreds of them, installing
Server Farmer gives you many advantages over default OS configuration:

- consistent and reliable tools to manage many servers at once (or one by one)
- several monitoring capabilities
- automatic, possibly encrypted backups
- working MTA configuration (your servers are now able to send emails)
- central logging configuration (all logs are stored and processed in one place, enhancing security of your infrastructure)
- more secure configurations of several system components (depending on OS version)

## Advantages of Server Farmer over competitive tools

There are many similar solutions: Puppet, Chef, Ansible, cfengine are the most
popular ones. What they have in common is that all of them:

- require much more resources just to be run
- utilize much more resources to handle typical tasks
- have way more steep learning curve
- are way more expensive to set up and use

Server Farmer basic configuration can be set up just in a few minutes and then
extended, when your server farm is growing. You can also implement your own
functional extensions (just like Ansible playbooks or Chef recipes, but much
more simple), that will cover completely new functionalities.

Server Farmer is the ideal tool to manage customers, who have 1-3 servers each
(up to let's say 1-20 servers), where most of such servers run well-known
applications and their configuration is similar to each other and close to
OS defaults where possible.

## How to install Server Farmer on your first server

([see the full manual](http://serverfarmer.org/getting-started.html))

- fork this repository
- edit file scripts/functions.custom, either using GIT or in the browser:

```
https://github.com/your-github-login/serverfarmer/edit/master/scripts/functions.custom
```

- clone it to your server, exactly to the /opt/farm directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-github-login/serverfarmer /opt/farm
```

- run `setup.sh` script and just follow the simple on-screen instructions:

```
/opt/farm/setup.sh
```

## How to deploy Server Farmer into cloud

Server Farmer supports the following public cloud providers:

- Amazon EC2
- Beyond e24cloud.com
- Google Compute Engine
- Microsoft Azure
- Rackspace Cloud
- any cloud service based on OpenStack (including public, private and hybrid clouds)

([see the full manual](http://serverfarmer.org/cloud-integration.html))

Initial setup:

- choose a server for the farm manager role (no special requirements, except that all management extensions are tested mainly on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
- install Server Farmer on it, and configure at least farm manager role (preferably also backup collector role)
- install Cloud Farmer on it and configure it by editing files in /opt/cloud/credentials directory
- install command line tools for your chosen cloud provider required by Cloud Farmer and connect them to your account

```
git clone https://github.com/serverfarmer/cloudfarmer /opt/cloud
```

- creating new cloud instance

```
/opt/cloud/create.sh ec2 test_key1 m4.xlarge
```

```
/opt/cloud/create.sh azure testkey2 Standard_A2
```

```
/opt/cloud/create.sh rackspace test_key3 compute1-60
```

```
/opt/cloud/create.sh e24cloud testkey4 m1.small
```

```
/opt/cloud/create.sh gce testkey5 n1-highcpu-2
```

- deploy Server Farmer on created instance

```
/opt/cloud/deploy.sh ec2-54-123-45-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com /etc/local/.ssh/id_ec2_test_key1
```

```
/opt/cloud/deploy.sh testkey2-5c82.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com /etc/local/.ssh/id_azure_testkey2
```

```
/opt/cloud/deploy.sh 162.209.99.47 /etc/local/.ssh/id_rack_test_key3
```

```
/opt/cloud/deploy.sh ip-178-216-203-155.e24cloud.com /etc/local/.ssh/id_rack_testkey4
```

```
/opt/cloud/deploy.sh 204.111.199.104.bc.googleusercontent.com /etc/local/.ssh/id_gce_testkey5
```
